# Cybersecurity Writeups & Notes

Welcome to my GitPage: [zujiniale.github.io](https://zujiniale.github.io)  
This site serves as a hub for my cybersecurity write-ups, walkthroughs, and training reflections.

## 🔍 What You'll Find Here

- Write-ups for **vulnerable machines** from platforms like **Hack The Box**, **OffSec**, **VulnHub**, and others  
- **CTF event solutions** and challenge breakdowns  
- Occasional **certification exam reviews** and study reflections

These write-ups help me strengthen my technical note-taking and reporting process — essential skills for real-world security assessments and red team engagements.
